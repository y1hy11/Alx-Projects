Portfolio — Personal Site
=========================

ALX Frontend Projects — Portfolio
================================

![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-HTML-orange)

A small, static portfolio page created as part of the ALX Frontend learning exercises. This single-page demo presents a simple structure for showcasing projects and contact information — I'm just trying to archive this.

🎯 Project Objectives
---------------------

- Provide a compact portfolio template for learning HTML structure and semantics
- Offer a simple, static page to showcase projects and contact details

📚 Pages / Contents
------------------

- `index.html` — Portfolio landing page

Project structure
-----------------

```text
HTML/portfolio/
└─ index.html
```

Note: global CSS/JS (if present) may live elsewhere under `HTML-CSS-JS/CSS` or `HTML-CSS-JS/JS`.

How to view locally
-------------------

Option A — Open directly  
Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

Option B — From VS Code  
Use the Live Server extension to serve the folder and get live reload.

Notes
-----

- Static site only — there is no backend. Forms will not persist data without a server or external form service.
