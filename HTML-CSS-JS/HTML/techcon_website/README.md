# ALX Frontend Projects — TechCon

![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-HTML-orange)

A small, static multi-page website built as part of the ALX Frontend learning projects. TechCon is a fictional technology conference site implemented with plain HTML (and optional global CSS/JS elsewhere in the repository).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Document frontend learning exercises from the ALX FE program
- Provide a simple, static multi-page example for practice
- Show common page structure, navigation, and static forms
- Serve as a reference when practicing local development and deployment

## 📚 Pages / Contents

- `index.html` — Home / landing page  
- `about.html` — About the conference  
- `schedule.html` — Schedule and sessions  
- `register.html` — Registration form (static)  
- `contact.html` — Contact form (static)

## Project structure

```
HTML/techcon_website/
├─ index.html
├─ about.html
├─ schedule.html
├─ register.html
├─ contact.html
└─ README.md
```

Note: global CSS/JS (if present) may live elsewhere under `HTML-CSS-JS/CSS` or `HTML-CSS-JS/JS`.

## How to view locally

Option A — Open directly  
Double-click any `.html` file (for example `index.html`) to open it in your default browser.

Option B — From VS Code  
Use the Live Server extension to serve the folder and get live reload.

## Notes

- This is a static site — there is no backend. Forms will not persist data unless connected to a server or external form service.  
- Check form `action` attributes in `register.html` and `contact.html` before integrating with a backend.  
- Intended for learning and demonstration only.
