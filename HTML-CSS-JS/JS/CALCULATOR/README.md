# JS Calculator

A simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple arithmetic logic ‚Äî suitable for learning front-end fundamentals.

## Features
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clear (C) and backspace functionality
- Responsive layout for small screens
- Keyboard input support (if implemented in script.js)

## Tech stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project structure
- index.html ‚Äî the calculator UI
- styles.css ‚Äî styling and responsive rules
- script.js ‚Äî calculator logic and event handlers
- README.md ‚Äî project documentation

(Your project may have slightly different filenames. Adjust paths above if needed.)

## How to run locally
1. Clone or copy the folder to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Use the on-screen buttons or keyboard to perform calculations.

## Notes for developers
- Keep logic in `script.js` small and modular. Consider functions for:
  - reading / updating the display
  - performing calculations safely (handle division by zero)
  - parsing input and managing operator precedence (if extending)
- Add unit tests or integration tests if you plan to extend behavior.

## Possible improvements
- Add parentheses and operator precedence parsing (e.g., shunting-yard algorithm)
- Add decimal support and better floating-point handling
- Add animation and accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus states)
- Implement persistent history or memory functions

### Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Optional: Node.js for running non-browser exercises
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
