## Examples

```cmd
:: See what files you have
dir

:: Make a new folder
md MyFolder

:: Make a copy of a file
copy MyFile.txt MyCopy.txt

:: Rename a file
move OldName.txt NewName.txt

:: Delete a file you don't want
del Unwanted.txt
```

What these commands do:
- `dir`: Shows you all the files in your current location
- `md MyFolder`: Creates a new folder (like creating a new folder in Windows Explorer)
- `copy MyFile.txt MyCopy.txt`: Makes a duplicate of your file (just like copy & paste)
- `move OldName.txt NewName.txt`: Gives your file a new name
- `del Unwanted.txt`: Throws away a file you don't need anymore
